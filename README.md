This repo is used to organize data collected by the NIMH Section for Developmental Neurogenomics according to the BIDS protocol. Much of the functionality was motivated by [xnat_downloader](https://github.com/NeuroimagingUIowa/xnat_downloader), but we're now using `heudiconv`.

Scripts used to launch other BIDS compatible neuroimaging processing pipelines are also added.
